Idea:

Because of limitations in technology (Micro:bit) and targeted “audience” 
(primary school children) project must not be too complex. 
Keeping in mind that project is aimed at kids I wanted to make something interactive that
will have a potential to inspire them to continue learning programming and using micro controllers. 
My love for game design pushed me to create simple game without graphics which would also be fit for blind people.

Story:

You are stuck in a sky labyrinth, sun has blinded you and only
thing u have by your side is a bag full of rocks ( don’t ask, you just have it) 

Game mechanics: 


Game is played on a board which consists of walking and sky tiles. 
Goal is to pass through the labyrinth while being blinded without falling out of the labyrinth ( stepping on the sky tile).
Since you are blind and can’t see where u are walking,
you’ll need to make use of those rocks you are carrying in your bag. 
When you throw a rock it will bounce of the floor or fall down if hits the sky tile. 
In short, player can throw rocks 3 tiles ahead of his position, if rock hits the floor tile 
it produces sound and glove vibrates, if it hits the sky tile nothing happens.

"technical" part:

Matrix filled with '0' and '1' is randomly generated.
Tiles with ones are floor tile while those with zeroes are sky tiles. 
Rocks have 3 tile range. Game checks  three tiles in front of the player and plays sounds
and vibrations accordingly. Micro:bit has integrated accelerometer which will be used as player controller. 
Location of player in matrix will change accordingly to how player moves his hand

Update:

Unfortunately, organisers found idea too complex for kids. Code will be up as soon as 
I get my hands on the Micro:bit (not a fan of uploading untested code).
